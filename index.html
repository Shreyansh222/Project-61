<h1>About</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<p class="para">My hobby is beyblade is a toy which comes in many variety like in mental an in plastic. It has a launcher an a wire to launch. It is very interesting children like to play with it. A cartoon also comes on T-V.<br>
Three of the main types of Beyblades have rock-paper-scissors style effectiveness, with Attack generally being weak to Defense, Defense to Stamina, and Stamina to Attack. However, due to the high variability of the custom designs, this is not a hard rule. Balance types may be strong or weak to any of the others depending on specific parts.<br>
Attack<br>
These Beyblades specialize in attacking other Beyblades. They battle fiercely and try to knock out the other Beyblade as fast as they can, but at the cost of having poor stamina. They tend to outperform Stamina-Type Beyblades due to their lack of defense. Attack type beys also have to be heavy too to be able to knock others out. They usually have flat or rubber performance tips and have layers which can grip onto the opponent.<br>
Defense<br>
These Beyblades specialize in knocking back attacks. They tend to travel slowly and are heavier than other types, resulting in opponents being deflected. Their weight also causes them to launch slower, resulting in less stamina. They tend to wear down Attack-types but are outlasted by Stamina. They are also very thick in terms of metal, and have wide ball-like performance tips.<br>
Stamina<br>
These Beyblades specialize in stamina. They are used so they can out-spin the enemy top and win. In exchange for a lack of power, their stamina lasts longer against other Types of Beyblades, making them naturally advantageous over Defense-Types, which focus on resisting hits. They have sharp cone shaped performance tips.<br>
Balance<br>
These Beyblades specialize in a combination of the other three types listed above, giving them no glaring strengths or weaknesses. They use a mix of Attack, Defense, and Stamina Types put together but do not excel in any particular trait. Some Balance Types have Attack, Defense, and Stamina Modes. And their performance tips can vary.</p>
